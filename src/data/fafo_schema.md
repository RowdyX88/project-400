# FA/FO Goals & Bills System - Complete Documentation & Schema

## üéØ **System Overview**

The FA/FO Goals & Bills system is a brutal historical timeline that exposes the gap between political promises (FA - Financial Assistance/Foreign Aid) and savage reality (FO - Financial Operations/Fallout). This system uses a 3-panel interactive interface where users can filter events by continent and year to see the complete picture of historical hypocrisy.

### **Core Concept:**
- **FA (Goals)** = The setup, the promise, the noble intention
- **Middle Man** = The politician/institution making the pitch with quotes and spin
- **FO (Fallout)** = The savage aftermath, the real consequences, the dark comedy

### **Middle Man Requirements:**
- **Actor:** Specific person or institution (no generic titles)
- **Quote:** Real quote preferred, believable paraphrase acceptable

- **Length:** 2-4 sentences with escalating brutality
- **Focus:** Long-term consequences, hypocrisy exposure, bitter irony
- **Language:** Sharp, sarcastic, pulls no punches
- **Targets:** Corporations, politicians, institutions, anyone complicit

### **Tags Guidelines:**

    "image": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/kissinger.jpg"
  },
  "fo": "Allende dead, Pinochet in power, thousands disappeared, and Chile's economy sold to Chicago Boys like a neoliberal yard sale. Kissinger still got a Nobel Prize ‚Äî comedy gold.",

## üéÆ **User Interface Behavior**

### **Filtering Logic:**
1. **Continent Selection:**
   - `"World"` = Shows all events regardless of continent
   - Any specific continent = Shows only events tagged with that continent
   - Visual feedback on button click (green flash)

2. **Year Slider:**
   - Range: 1900-2025
   - Real-time filtering as user drags
   - Current year display updates dynamically
   - Only shows events matching exact year

3. **Combined Filtering:**
   - Continent + Year filters work together
   - No matches = "No events found" placeholder
   - Single match = Full FA/Middle/FO display

### **Panel Content Display:**
- **FA Panel:** Shows `fa` content with year and continent in header
- **Middle Panel:** Shows actor image, name, and quote with styling
- **FO Panel:** Shows `fo` content with tags displayed as chips

## üöÄ **Adding New Content**

### **Step-by-Step Process:**
1. **Research the Event:** Find the setup, the spin, and the aftermath
2. **Identify the Middle Man:** Who was selling the narrative?
3. **Write the FA:** What was the goal/promise/intention?
4. **Find the Quote:** Real quote preferred, believable paraphrase OK
5. **Write the FO:** Go full savage, no mercy, expose the hypocrisy
6. **Add Tags:** 3-6 relevant, specific keywords
7. **Validate JSON:** Use schema validation
8. **Test Filtering:** Verify continent/year combinations work

### **Content Guidelines:**
- **Historical Accuracy:** Facts must be verifiable
- **Savage Commentary:** FO should be brutal but intelligent
- **No Sacred Cows:** Target any institution, leader, or corporation
- **Global Perspective:** Cover all continents and decades
- **Dark Humor:** Make it sting, make it memorable
